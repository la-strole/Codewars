# The Hashtag Generator

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:
- It must start with a hashtag (#).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.
- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

Examples:
!['example'](https://github.com/la-strole/codewars/blob/master/The%20Hashtag%20Generator/images/example.png)

### How to run:
`python3 hashtag_gen.py` print hashtag from `test_string`.
