An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

    "Dermatoglyphics" --> true
    "aba" --> false
    "moOse" --> false (ignore letter casing)
   
### How to run:
`python3 isogram.py` - print if `test_string` is isogram.
