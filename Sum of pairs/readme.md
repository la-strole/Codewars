Negative numbers and duplicate numbers can and will appear.

NOTE: There will also be lists tested of lengths upwards of 10,000,000 elements. Be sure your code doesn't time out.
### How to run:
`python3 sum_of_pairs.py` where `ints` - list of integers, `s` - summ we are looking for. Print list with result.
