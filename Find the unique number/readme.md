# Find the unique number (6 kyu)

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

`findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2`<br/>
`findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55`<br/>

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

### How to run:
`python3 unique_number.py` print unique number in `test_array`.
